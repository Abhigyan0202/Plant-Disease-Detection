Follow the steps below to use the model:

    Train the Model
    Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model. Save the trained model as a .pth file.

    Update the Model Path
    In the app.py file, update the model path with the location of the .pth file on your device.

    Run the Streamlit App
    Start the Streamlit app using the following command:
    streamlit run app.py

  Make sure that all the necessary libraries are installed.
